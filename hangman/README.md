# The Hangman.



This is the typical hangman game built in console engine, a crate that's built on top of crossterm crate which allow us to write anything and capture mouse and keyboard events in the terminal.

In order to play just run the program and try to guess the concealed word; to quit just press the escape key.

Good luck.
