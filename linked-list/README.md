## Linked list in rust

This is a small readme I wrote about how I managed to craft a linked list in rust, as far as the implementation I have to say it's not that compelling, but given this particular data structure is normally tricky to do in rust I give myself some credit for being able to do this despite of being a beginner rustacean.

Before I dive into the nitty gritty details of how I did it, I would like to talk about what a linked list is:

> An ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor (and sometimes its predecessor).
